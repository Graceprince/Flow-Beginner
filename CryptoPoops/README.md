# CryptoPoops-Project

I added a function called borrowAuthNFT into the NFT contract that was providedand make it publicly accessible to other people so they can read our NFT's metadata.

## Usage

Create your Contracts, Transactions and Scripts files on the Flow Playground.
Run the CreateCollection transaction.
Run the MintNFT tracnsaction.
Run the GetNftIds script to get the nft id for running the main script.
Run the GetMetaData Script and it will return the data from the created nft.
